We have tried to explain everything through the video.
We have also shown the demo there.
In devfolio, in the zip file we have not included the img files because we cannot zip the img files. But we have uploaded the same in our github repository please use that as the base for judging.
The tool which we are making is very easy to operate as we use sticky notes.
Hope everyone finds it very easy to operate.
We are sure we would develop it more in the coming future and make it more refreshing and presentable than it is now.
We have tried to touch as many as issues as we can within this short time interval.
At last thanks for allowing us to participate.
